1. Assume I plan to use the friend_overlap function above to quantify the
similarity of two users. E.g., because 344 is larger than 1, I conclude that
Jill Stein and Gary Johnson are more similar than Hillary Clinton and Donald
Trump.

How is this approach misleading? How might you fix it?

The similarity between two users can be defined by finding the probabilities because the count of friends for all the users are randomly distributed. 

The overlap friends for Jill Stein and Gary Johnson = 238
Using get_friends functions we can find the total friends for all the 4 users.
Total friends for Jill Stein = 1645
Total friends for Gary Johnson = 3482
Total friends for Hillary Clinton = 762
Total friends for Donald Trump = 45

Probability(Jill Stein & Gary Johnson) = 238/(1645+3482) = 238/5127 =0.04642

Probability(Hillary Clinton & Donald Trump) = 1/(762+45) = 0.001239


As probability of Jill Stein and Gray Johnson is high compared to Hillary Clinton & Donald Trump, I conclude that Jill Stein & Gary are more similar.




2. Looking at the output of your followed_by_hillary_and_donald function, why
do you think this user is followed by both Hilary Clinton and Donald Trump,
who are rivals? Do some web searches to see if you can find out more
information.



WhiteHouse is the user who is following both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. All the current news are tweeted in this page.
I didn't understand the rivals part here. WhiteHouse is not a rival for both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.









3. There is a big difference in how many accounts each candidate follows (Gary
Johnson follows over 3K accounts, while Donald Trump follows less than
50). Why do you think this is? How might that affect our analysis?


The Gary Johnson might be very active in Twitter where as Donald Trump is less active. Analysis in this case might be biased because of
less data for Trump compared to Gary






4. The follower graph we've collected is incomplete. To expand it, we would
have to also collect the list of accounts followed by each of the
friends. That is, for each user X that Donald Trump follows, we would have to
also collect all the users that X follows. Assuming we again use the API call
https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/friends/ids, how many requests will
we have to make? Given how Twitter does rate limiting
(https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/rate-limiting), approximately how many
minutes will it take to collect this data?

Suppose Donald Trump has 45 friends. And if we want to collect the total followers for 45 friends
it will take 45/15 which is 3 window sessions. It will take 30 minutes to collect the entire data.
